This is my first project ever!

This project is for Code Louisville Web Dev Course 1. I took the visual mockups shown in the "mockups" folder and created the code you see here! At this moment, the homepage and menu are completely finished and the rest will soon follow. The list of required features for the project that can be found on this page includes:

A responsive navigation bar with Javascript, PageSpeed Insights score of 100 on both mobile and desktop (as of 11/18/2022), transition elements used (opacity transition upon hovering over the "View Menu" button, and an in-and-out transition on the mobile navigation bar), and a show/hide div made with CSS on the bottom of the homepage.

I hope this website makes you want some coffee!
