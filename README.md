This is my first project ever!

This project is for Code Louisville Web Dev Course 1. I took the visual mockups shown in the "mockups" folder and created the code you see here! At this moment, the homepage and menu are completely finished and the rest will soon follow. The list of required features for the project that can be found on this page includes:

A responsive navigation bar with Javascript, PageSpeed Insights score of 100 on both mobile and desktop (as of 11/18/2022), transition elements used (opacity transition upon hovering over the "View Menu" button, and an in-and-out transition on the mobile navigation bar), and a show/hide div made with CSS on the bottom of the homepage.

I hope this website makes you want some coffee!

*UPDATE*

This is also my project for the second half of the program, Code Louisville Web Dev Course 2! The only thing needed to run this project is an API key, which I can personally give to my reviewer upon request :) The 3 required features I have chosen are:
1) Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app." -- The hours of operation on the "Location" page are stored in an array
2) "Use a regular expression to validate user input and either prevent the invalid input or inform the user about it (in all cases prevent invalid input from being stored or saved)." -- The "Contact" page will display a message notifying the user if they input an invalid email format
3) "Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app." -- The map on the "Location" page is called via API (ask me for the key!)

I hope this website makes you reeeeally want some coffee!
