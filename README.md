This is my first project ever!
Project is for Code Louisville Web Dev 1. I took the visual mockups shown in the project files and created the code you see here! At this moment, the homepage is completely finished and the rest will soon follow.
List of required features include:
Responsive navigation bar with Javascript
PageSpeed Insights Score of 89 (as of today, 11/17/2022)
Transition elements used (opacity transition on the "View Menu" button, and an in-and-out transition on the mobile navigation bar)
A show/hide div made with CSS on the bottom of the "index" page
